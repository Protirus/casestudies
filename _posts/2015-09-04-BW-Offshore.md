BW Offshore were previously managing their requests through emails and had little tracking, management and history of any recorded issues.

They were looking for a solution where they could manage incidents in a single place and audit the activity against them.

Using Symantec Service  Desk has solved their business issues and they have achieved control  over their incoming requests.
